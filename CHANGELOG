1.0.6
=====
Properly package and distribute using conda

The prior version of `ibei`, which was [hosted on
pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibei/), directly included the
[`physicalproperty`](https://github.com/jrsmith3/physicalproperty)
code in its codebase. The `physicalproperty` code has been removed
from this release in favor of an `import`.

`ibei is now available on binstar via conda install since it depends
`on numpy. New versions will only be distributed on binstar and not
`pypi due to difficulties installing numpy.

The online documentation has moved to
[ReadTheDocs](http://ibei.rtfd.org) and is no longer hosted with
github pages. The documentation has also been edited for clarity.

This package now uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/jrsmith3/ibei)
for continuous integration testing.
